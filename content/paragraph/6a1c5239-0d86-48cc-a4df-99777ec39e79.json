However, an alternative path allows for the intervening years to be only one thousand, if Seldon is allowed to collect the most intelligent minds and create a compendium of all human knowledge, entitled <em><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Encyclopedia_Galactica\">Encyclopedia Galactica<\/a><\/em>.

The vault reveals a pre-recorded <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hologram\">hologram<\/a> of Seldon, who informs the Encyclopedists that their entire reason for being on Terminus is a fraud, insofar as Seldon did not actually care whether or not an encyclopedia was created, only that the population was placed on Terminus and the events needed by his calculations were set in motion. In reality, the recording discloses, Terminus was set up to reduce the dark ages from 30,000 years to just one millennium, based on following his calculations. It will develop by facing intermittent and extreme \"crises\" \u2013 known as \"Seldon Crises\" \u2013 which the laws governing psychohistory show will inevitably be overcome, simply because human nature will cause events to fall in particular ways which lead to the intended goal.

Meanwhile, the minds of the Foundation continue to develop newer and greater technologies which are smaller and more powerful than the Empire's equivalents. Using its scientific advantage, Terminus develops trade routes with nearby planets, eventually taking them over when its technology becomes a much-needed commodity. The interplanetary traders effectively become the new diplomats to other planets. One such trader, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hober_Mallow\">Hober Mallow<\/a>, becomes powerful enough to challenge and win the seat of Mayor and, by cutting off supplies to a nearby region, also succeeds in adding more planets to the Foundation's reach.<\/p>\r\n",
